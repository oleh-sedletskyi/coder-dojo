# Blog project

[Live Demo – StarWars Blog](https://blog.907050.xyz)
[Demo source code (Clojure)](https://github.com/oleh-sedletskyi/demo-blog)

- Topics covered
	- Introduction to Markdown (MD)
		- MD is selected because it is a simple way to format the document and keep this formatting in a human-readable way. 
		- We can use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for editing and preview
	- Python
		- Python will be used to transform each Markdown post/article into HTML as a separate pages on the Blog site
			- Objectives
				- Introduction to Python programming language, REPL and some of its features
				- Using Python with some libraries to convert Markdown documents into HTML and embed it into HTML templates
	- HTML+CSS
		- Basic HTML & CSS will be used to create index and article pages templates. For anyone who wants to make the HTML look pretty out of the box we can use a simple CSS library, like [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com)
	- Git
		- Introduction to Git version control system to keep history of the project evolution. If command line is overwhelming at the beginning, we can use some GUI client like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)
	- GitHub (with GitHub Pages & Actions)
		- Using GitHub Pages will allow having the blog available online under `repository-name.github.io` address
		- GitHub Actions
			- Enabling GitHub Actions will allow HTML content being regenerated and deployed on each push to GitHub
		- Objectives
			- Generating SSH Key
			- Introduction to the source code management
	- Custom Domain
		- Registering an their domain will allow hosting blog on a separate domain
		- Objectives
			- Registering custom domain name
			- Getting familiar with DNS records
	- OpenAI api
		- Calling OpenAI API can generate keywords and description for each post/article
		- While leveraging embeddings API we can calculate and show similar posts
		- Objectives
			- Registering a new OpenAI account
				- Otherwise api tokens can be created for each participant from one of the mentor's account in a dedicated openai project (to easier tracking of usage)
			- Calling OpenAI API from Python code
			- Handling tokens/secrets
				- Main idea to not commit tokens
					- keep them in a dedicated file added to .gitignore or export as an env variables
- Lessons breakdown
	- Pre-requisites/Setup
		- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
		- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
			- VS Code proposes to download Git from the Git tab
			- Most of the default options work during the installation, but it is better to pick `main` branch as a default one (previously was `master`)
		- Install [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)
			- Here we need to define user name/email that will be used for each commit
		- Download [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com)
		- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
		- Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- Lesson 1: Define project with templates
		- Template for index page with a list of all pages
		- Template for a page
	- Lesson 2: Add a couple of MD files with content to be used
		- ToDo
- ToDo
	- Topic breakdown plan by lesson
	- Figure out
		- Project structure
		- Python library to use for Markdown->HTML conversion
		- How to run frequently used project commands
		- How to watch files changes and regenerate the content on each file change for instant feedback
		- We will need an internet connection for (can use hotspot for that)
			- Python installation?
			- Pushing source code to GitHub
			- GitHub Pages
			- GitHub Actions
			- Accessing OpenAI api (responses/embeddings)
